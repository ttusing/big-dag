# big-dag
Big DAG is a DBT project that is made to test compile time performance of "large" DBT projects. The goal is to have a DBT project with perhaps at least 100 models and 10,000 nodes with a depth of at least 10 models to test the compile time of running DBT across different versions of the dbt-core package.

Big DAG will also be a simple demonstration of how to use some tools, such as seeds, public datasets, DuckDB, Github actions, and DBT benchmarking.
